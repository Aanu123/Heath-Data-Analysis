# Project Title: Exploratory Health Outcome Data Analysis

# Project Overview
### This healthcare dataset  comprises information on various diseases, including indicators such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty in breathing. Additionally, it includes cholesterol levels, outcome variables (positive or negative), and age. The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset and derive insights related to the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Top Positive Result by Disease:
Identify the disease with the highest positive results within the dataset.
Understand the distribution of positive results across different diseases.
- Positive Result by Gender:
Analyze and compare positive results based on gender.
Determine if there are gender-specific trends in positive outcomes.
Visualize the distribution of positive results among males and females.
- Cholesterol Level by Age Group:
Investigate the distribution of cholesterol levels within different age groups (e.g., young, adults and the old).
Identify the age group with the highest cholesterol levels.
# Project Steps
### Data Exploration and Understanding:
- Loaded the dataset in csv and examine its structure using Power BI(Get Data)
### Data Cleaning and Wrangling:  
- Removal of duplicate rows,missing values and use of the right data type using power query editor in Power BI
- Group age into categories (e.g., young adults and the elderly) using Calculated Column in Power Query editor
- Categorize cholesterol levels (low, normal, and high) using Calculated Column in Power Query editor
### Calculating KPIs Using Calculated Measures
- Determined the disease with the highest positive results.
- Analyze positive results by gender.
- Investigate cholesterol levels within different age groups.
### Data Analysis and Visualization:
- Used statistical methods to derive insights into the identified KPIs.
- Created visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and histograms to represent key findings.
### Key Findings:
- Highest Positive Result is Ulcer Cognitis
- Highest Positive Result by Gender is Female
- Cholesterol Level by Age Group, Adults exhibit higher cholesterol levels across all categories.

### Recommendations
- Given that Ulcer Cognitis has been identified as having the highest positive results, implementing targeted interventions, awareness campaigns, or screenings for this specific disease.
- Collaboration with healthcare professionals to develop specialized programs for early detection and management of Ulcer Cognitis.
- Since females exhibit a higher prevalence of positive results, consider designing health initiatives specifically tailored to address the needs of women.
- Promoting regular health check-ups, screenings, and awareness programs to empower females to take proactive measures for their health.
- Higher prevalence of high cholesterol levels among adults,Implementing health education programs emphasizing the importance of a healthy lifestyle, including diet and exercise, to manage and prevent high cholesterol levels in the adult population.
